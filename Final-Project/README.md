# Final Project: Tic Tac Toe!

## Overview

Hooray! You've made it to the end of the semester! You should be proud of what you accomplished and all you learned. This is the last assignment of the semester, and it's time to put your coding abilities to the test. For the final project, you will be creating a game of Tic Tac Toe. You will implemenet an interface in the terminal that allows a user to play the game. This includes a way to see the board, as well as splash screens that show when the game has loaded up as well as when the game is over (win or draw). This assigment will be done indvually.

## Background

If you're not familiar with the game of Tic Tac Toe, you can find a great explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Hopefully you are familiar with the rules of the game, and how to play it. Other than that, the other background will need is from what you learned in the class.

## Set Up

You've been hired by ***Good Vibe Games*** in order to create a game of Tic Tac Toe. They are looking to build a retro terminal version of the game. They are looking for a beautiful design and a functional game.

The ultimate goal of this assignment is to have a working Tic Tac Toe game with some splash screens. However, how you get there is up to you. The only requirement is that you use a struct called `TicTacToeGame`.  

I have given a few suggestions of functions that might be helpful to you in your implementation. Again, these functions are not required. These functions and the struct can be seen in the skeleton of this assignment.

It is also important to remember to not take anything from the interent! I **will** be checking for copy and paste. It's okay to look for inspiration but copy paste is not allowed. 

You may have also noticed I have provided a splash screen for the start up of this program. This can be used as inspiration for the splash screens you create. As well as be used in teh begining of the game.


## Your Task

Make a fully functioning Tic Tac Toe Game that uses splash screens.
