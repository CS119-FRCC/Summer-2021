### Intro to Programming C++

## Welcome Message

Welcome to CSC119! My name is Matthew Ernst, and I will be your instructor for this course. A little about me, I am currently a graduate student at Colorado State University specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning in optimal neuron selection for neural networks. Aside from computer science I am a big music/guitar fan. I am excited to be teaching this course this summer. It will be a fresh take on learning C++ by building a raytracer. This may sound intimidating; however, I know all of you will be able to do it. Before class starts, you are more than welcome to email me with any questions about this course. I look forward to meeting you all!
